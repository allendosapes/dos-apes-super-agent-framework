# Architecture Rules (machine-readable)

> Generated by the architect agent during Phase 1 after tech stack decisions.
> Used by `scripts/check-structure.sh` to enforce dependency direction on every file edit.
> Update this file when architectural boundaries change (new layers, new modules).

## Dependency Direction

# Format: SOURCE_DIR -> ALLOWED_DEPS (comma-separated)
# Imports from unlisted directories are violations.
# Use (none) for leaf modules that should have no internal imports.

src/types -> (none)
src/config -> src/types
src/lib -> src/types, src/config
src/services -> src/types, src/config, src/lib
src/hooks -> src/types, src/services, src/lib
src/components -> src/types, src/hooks, src/lib, src/services
src/pages -> src/types, src/components, src/hooks, src/services, src/lib

## Boundary Walls

# Format: SOURCE_DIR -> FORBIDDEN_TARGET
# These are explicit "never import" rules regardless of direction.

src/components -> src/pages
src/services -> src/components
src/lib -> src/services
src/hooks -> src/components
